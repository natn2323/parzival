# About this project

The technology that this project currently uses are a Vanilla JavaScript frontend, a Node.js backend, with a SQLite3 in-memory database. 
This project is still in development. Development began on July 7th, 2018.


# Our motivation

At Exsilio Solution's inaugural "Ready Hacker One" hackathon in the summer of 2018, we were presented with the challenge of creating 
a web-based ordering system for a mockup diner, "Bonnie's Vegan Cuisine".

Frankly, though our team consisted of college graduates, we were lacking in experience when it came to web development--building a 
website / web application "from the ground up". The technology requirements were the following: any frontend, .NET or Node.js middleware, and
any backend. Though there was freedom with these requirements, our lack of experience and the additional business requirements for the
application challenged us beyond our capabilities *at the time*.

So although the hackathon is over, we're here, *now*, continuing our work on this project--as both in an attempt to save our egos,
but also more importantly to continue learning about things we didn't know before.

# About us

"Parzival" was the name of our team. The name served as an allusion to the protagonist's alias in the movie, *Ready Player One*. 
Our team consisted of 4 members: Chase H. (backend database, Python, SQL), Mohan G. (full stack), Nathan N. (full stack), and Someel P. (frontend Angular).
These roles were loosely defined, somewhat based on our experience with other technologies.
